# Dabr

Dabr is designed to be a **fast** and **free** way to access Twitter via *any* mobile phone.

It is specifically targeted at users with limited bandwidth, slow computers / phones, or those who just prefer a **simple** website.

To play with the latest version of Dabr, visit https://dabr.eu/

This is a fork of the [original Dabr code](https://code.google.com/p/dabr/) by one of its main contributors.
